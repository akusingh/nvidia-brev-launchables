# HuggingFace Authentication
# ==========================
# 
# Copy this file to `.env` and add your HuggingFace token
# WARNING: Never commit .env to version control!
# 
# Three ways to authenticate:
# 
# 1. RECOMMENDED - Use huggingface-cli (interactive, most secure)
#    Run: huggingface-cli login
#    This stores your token securely in ~/.cache/huggingface/token
# 
# 2. Environment Variable (for automation/CI/CD)
#    Uncomment and set your token below:
#    HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# 
# 3. .env file (for local development)
#    Uncomment and set your token below:
#    setup.sh will automatically source this file

# Get your token from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# Create a token with "read" access to download models

# HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Optional: Set HuggingFace cache directory
# HF_HOME=~/.cache/huggingface

# Optional: Disable tokenizers parallelism to avoid warnings
# TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false
