# 🎉 Project Migration Complete!

Your Finnish TTS training environment has been successfully reorganized and cleaned up.

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Cleaned Up Old Files**
Removed LLM fine-tuning content:
- ❌ Deleted: `llm_finetuning.ipynb`
- ❌ Deleted: `configs/` (LLM configs)
- ❌ Deleted: `utils/` (LLM utilities)
- ❌ Deleted: Old `README.md` and `setup.sh`

### 2. **Created Clean Structure**

### 3. **Added Helper Scripts**

Created convenient shortcuts:
- `monitor.sh` → Quick training monitor
- `convert.sh` → Quick dataset converter
- `test.sh` → Quick model tester

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### First Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /Users/arunkumar.singh/nvidia-brev

# 2. Run setup (installs everything)
bash setup.sh

# 3. Prepare your dataset
# Place audio files in: datasets/finnish-tts-raw/audio/
# Create metadata.csv in: datasets/finnish-tts-raw/

# 4. Convert dataset
bash convert.sh

# 5. Start training
jupyter notebook finnish-tts-model-training.ipynb
```

### Monitor Training

In a separate terminal:
```bash
cd /Users/arunkumar.singh/nvidia-brev
bash monitor.sh --watch
```

## 🎯 What's Different from fish-speech/repo?

### This Project (nvidia-brev/)
- ✅ **Focused**: Finnish TTS only, no clutter
- ✅ **Organized**: Clear structure, easy to navigate
- ✅ **Documented**: Complete guides for every step
- ✅ **Brev-Optimized**: GPU recommendations, cost tips
- ✅ **Production-Ready**: All tools and scripts included

### Original (fish-speech/repo/)
- Contains full Fish Speech codebase
- Multiple projects and experiments
- General-purpose, not Finnish-specific
- More files to navigate

---

## 🔗 Relationship to fish-speech/

Your `nvidia-brev/` project **uses** Fish Speech but is **separate**:

```
fish-speech/              (Full codebase, kept intact)
├── repo/
│   ├── fish_speech/      ← Used by training
│   ├── tools/            ← Used by training
│   └── ...

nvidia-brev/              (Your clean TTS project)
├── setup.sh              ← References fish-speech
├── finnish-tts-...ipynb  ← Uses fish-speech tools
└── ...
```

The setup script clones/uses Fish Speech but your project stays clean!

---

## 🎓 Next Steps

### 1. **Test the Setup**
```bash
cd /Users/arunkumar.singh/nvidia-brev
bash setup.sh
```

### 2. **Read the Documentation**
Start with: `README.md`  
Quick commands: `QUICKSTART.md`  
Deep dive: `docs/README_FINNISH_TTS.md`

### 3. **Prepare Your Dataset**
Follow: `datasets/README.md`

### 4. **Start Training**
Open: `finnish-tts-model-training.ipynb`

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Brev Users
- Use L40S (12GB) for testing, A100 (40GB) for production
- Download checkpoints before shutdown!
- Create a Launchable to share your setup

### For Local Development
- The setup script works on Linux (Brev) and macOS
- On Mac, some system packages may need Homebrew
- GPU features require CUDA-capable hardware

### For Best Results
- Use 2000+ training steps
- Validate dataset quality before training
- Monitor GPU utilization (aim for 85%+)
- Save checkpoints frequently

---

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Check the documentation**: `docs/README_FINNISH_TTS.md`
2. **Re-run setup**: `bash setup.sh`
3. **Check GPU**: `nvidia-smi`
4. **Monitor logs**: `bash monitor.sh`
5. **Validate data**: Run Step 5.1 in notebook

---

## 📝 File Sizes

Approximate storage requirements:

- Setup + Base Model: ~5 GB
- Dataset (2000 samples): ~2-3 GB
- Training Checkpoints: ~500 MB
- Final Model: ~200 MB
- **Total**: ~8-10 GB

---
